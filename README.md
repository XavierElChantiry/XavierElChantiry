# Heyo
## Who am I?
I am a formally trained DevOps engineer from BCIT, which is true, but that's not who I am; it's what I am.

I am really just a guy who likes tech, code, and games and has had the luck of making what he enjoys into his source of income. I am someone who is lucky, as I got to work with great people and do some fun things working at Blackbird Interactive.
